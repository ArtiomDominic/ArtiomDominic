# Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I'm a cloud developer who spends way too much time tinkering with infrastructure and dreaming about the perfect self-hosted setup.

## What I Do 💼

Currently working as a **Cloud Developer** with a healthy dose of DevOps thrown into the mix. I'm all about building robust cloud infrastructure and creating PaaS solutions that actually make developers' lives easier (or at least that's the goal!).

My daily playground includes:
- ☁️ **Azure** (my main squeeze) and **AWS** 
- 🏗️ Infrastructure design and automation

## Tech Stack 🛠️

**Languages I speak fluently:**
```
🐍 Python      # My go-to for almost everything
🐚 Shell       # Because who doesn't love a good bash script?
🏗️ Bicep       # Azure's infrastructure language of choice
⚡ C++         # When I need that extra performance kick
```

**Tools that keep me sane:**
- 🐳 Docker & Kubernetes - containerization is life
- 🐧 Linux - my happy place
- 🗄️ SQL - data needs love too
- 🔄 GitHub CI/CD & Git - because automation > manual work
- ⛵ Helm - sailing through K8s deployments
- And probably a dozen other tools I've forgotten about...

## When I'm Not at Work 🏠

I'm probably down some rabbit hole related to:

🏠 **Self-hosting everything** - Why use someone else's cloud when you can build your own mini data center in your closet?

🤖 **Smart home automation** - My house is slowly becoming sentient, and I'm here for it

🔓 **Open source smart home projects** - Always on the lookout for the next cool project to contribute to or completely over-engineer
